In 2020 i have lost a 3tb hard disk full of Pictures,videos,Surveillance Camera etc ..
So i used Photorec on it and luckly i could get back almost all those precious files to me .
Then i use this script SortPhotoRec.py to create a directory for each file extension .
The only problem for me was that i needed to sort 3tb of pictures and most of them were from
my surveillance camera system . 
So iv made this script to do the job .
TensorSeekam is based on Tensorflow and is able to make the difference between pictures taken
via any device and the pictures made from my 3 ipcams.
I tried to teach it to sort ipcam file by places and timestamp.
If it cannot determine timestamp from metadata , it will try to search in the picture a timestamp and read it.
Then it will put all this data in the correct directory .

It's been a year now that it is running on my computer and finally it has done all its homeworks.
Goodjob program !
